3. Once all questions have been filled out, run the npm install command to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

This app can be used to automatically create a readme file for any project. [Here](./walkthrough%20video/screen-capture.webm) is a video explaining how the application works. If github says the file is too big, click "view raw" and save the video to your local computer to be able to open it and view it.
